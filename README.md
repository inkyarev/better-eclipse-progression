# Better Eclipse Progression

## Whatawhy
This is a mod for RoR2 that by default makes it so that each unique max eclipse level win increases all survivors eclipse level by one.

I made it 'cause i thought having to play each character 8 times for seemingly no reason at all was dumb. This provides a sorta elegant solution that keeps the original "prove yourself worthy on each character", but makes it less extreme.

### Note on "unique max eclipse level win"
Unique max eclipse level win means that you have beaten the maximum eclipse level(8 for vanilla) for the first time **no matter whether this mod was installed when you did that or not**.

## Trivia
Original game requires you to get **16 * 8 = 128 _(!!)_** wins in order to get golden eclipse 8.
With mods adding new characters this number only grows further and further.

With this mod using the optimal route (getting 8 characters to E8 in a row) you can shrink that number down to 36.
